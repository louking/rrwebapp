Manage Age Grade Tables
-------------------------------------------
Age grade tables are created using the :ref:`Age Grade Tables view`, and the age grade factors
are imported using the **Import Factors** button on that view.

The age grade factors must be in the format used by https://github.com/AlanLyttonJones/Age-Grade-Tables, 
e.g., https://github.com/AlanLyttonJones/Age-Grade-Tables/blob/master/2020%20Files/FemaleRoadStd2020.xlsx.

The track standards in this directory go down to 1500 meters, and are from 2005/2006. Since **scoretility** 
may need to manage results for shorter races, and the 2015 factors included standards for these shorter
distances from 2010, suitable files are created based on the 
`excel file <http://www.howardgrubb.co.uk/athletics/data/wavacalc15.xls>`_ which can be downloaded from
http://www.howardgrubb.co.uk/athletics/wmalookup15.html.
