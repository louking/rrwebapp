This describes the format for importing results from the scoretility Races view.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
File Types,,,,,,
---------------------------------------,,,,,,
The following file types are allowed.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
* text - text files are files which can be viewed in a text editor as columns of data fields,,,,,,
,,,,,,
  * columns are defined by the character positions of the heading fields,,,,,,
  * column first character position is the same as the first character position of the heading field,,,,,,
  * column last character position is two characters before the first character position of the **next** heading field (or at the end of the record for the final column),,,,,,
  * note this means that the column heading has to be left justified in the column,,,,,,
"  * tab characters are permitted -- after a tab character the character position is considered to be at the next n*8 character position boundary, where n is an integer",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"* csv - comma separated value as specified within `RFC 4180 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180>`_, with exceptions that line breaks are not permitted within fields",,,,,,
,,,,,,
File Contents,,,,,,
---------------------------------------,,,,,,
"File contents are the file header for the first row, and the race results with a row for each race result. The fields are aligned as defined in File Types above. This section defines the permitted column heading names, and describes the type of data to be found underneath those headings.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"The headings may be of any case. For instance, Name and name are equivalent. Spaces after the headings are not significant, however, as noted above for text files, headings must start in the same character position as the data (i.e., headings must not be centered).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Alternate Headings are given, separated by commas. Note the commas are not part of the alternate headings.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
**Notes:**,,,,,,
,,,,,,
* required fields are in **bold**,,,,,,
* column order is not specified or implied by the order of fields in this table,,,,,,
"* other fields may be present, are ignored",,,,,,
,,,,,,
