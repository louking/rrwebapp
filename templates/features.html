  <h2>{{_rrwebapp_productname|safe}} Administration</h2>
  <p>
    {{_rrwebapp_productname|safe}} will will allow administrators to
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>update club membership via spreadsheet import</li>
    <li>update races via spreadsheet import or add races individually</li>
    <li>set up divisions</li>
    <li>set up race series</li>
    <li>set up which races are in which series</li>
    <li>import race results from a spreadsheet or text file</li>
    <ul>
      <li>smart import tries to match each name in the results file with a club member name, and
      makes suggestions for slight mismatches</li>
      <li>e.g., if Jenny Jones is seen on race result, and Jennifer Jones is in the membership, Jennifer Jones will be suggested</li>
    </ul>
    <li>adjust and confirm guesses which were made by the smart race results import</li>
    <ul>
      <li>once confirmed, the decision made is remembered so the same guess is not made for a later results import</li>
      <li>e.g., the smart import might suggest a result for John Smith matches John Smothers -- when the administrator
      indicates this is not correct, this association will not be suggested for future race results imports</li>
    </ul>
    <li>tabulate results into race series results</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>{{_rrwebapp_productname|safe}} For Everyone</h2>
  <p>
    {{_rrwebapp_productname|safe}} will allow club members (and everyone else who knows the link) to
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>view club standings</li>
    <li>view club race series results</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>{{_rrwebapp_productname|safe}} For Your Club</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>{{_rrwebapp_productname|safe}} keeps different clubs' information separate, i.e., separate membership, races, division, series, results, standings, by club</li>
  </ul>
